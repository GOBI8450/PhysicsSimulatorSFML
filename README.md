# PhysicsSimulatorSFML
A physics simulator made by a street fella who just wanted to code in c++ and realized how fun it is!(im suffering every second I code in this diabolical language)
Now you can:
Spawn balls (:
Spawn rectangle ):
Connect objects to each other
Spawn a planet with gravity (make the gravity in the settings struct to 0 for it to work good!!!)
Wonder why this project will benefit someone? it wont my fellas no it wont!

!Thread Pool not working yet!
